# Fingerfonetik

*Fingerfonetik* (or *finger phonetics*) is a proposed addition to the Swedish
Sign Language [transcription system] which make it possible to transcribe a
handshape finger-by-finger.

This can be useful both to distinguish allophones, and to transcribe new
handshapes that doesn't already have an established symbol in the Swedish
transcription system.
