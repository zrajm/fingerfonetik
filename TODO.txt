** [2/2] Rewrite all commit messages
   CLOSED: [2019-02-28 Thu 01:41]
*** DONE Remove mentions of project name
    CLOSED: [2019-02-28 Thu 01:41]
    Basically every commit message mentions which project it belongs to, this
    is redundant when the project gets its own repo.
*** DONE Remove trailing periods
    CLOSED: [2019-02-28 Thu 01:41]
    All commit messages ends in a period, but this is not best practice so
    let's undo that since we're rewriting history anyway.
